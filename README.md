### Running the modified script (MATLAB)
1. In /bg_model_matlab_run/ open run_conditions.m
2. Execute each block, the first block will prompt you to browse to the location of the original model
3. Before running the simulation step, there are multiple conditions to simulate (ie: Healthy vs PD + DBS-/DBS+)
4. After simulation, there are a few ways to visualize the data in the following blocks.
